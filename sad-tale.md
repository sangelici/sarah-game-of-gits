House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Or so he thought. Turns out there were people who wanted to get their hands on as much power as possible and they'd be willing to do pretty much anything to get it. Ned ended up with his head on the chopping block while his poor wife and children watched on.

His two daughters who's names escape me experienced plenty of tragedy but ended up as the most powerful women of the story.

This sounds like a great show to binge watch!
